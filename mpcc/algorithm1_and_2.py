    # Based on the paper (eq 20), alpha is calculated from the maximum value of x^T P x
    # for x such that ||Kx||_inf <= max_acc. Here, we approximate with a conservative margin.
    # A more rigorous method involves finding the maximum eigenvalue of K^T R K * P^-1
    # or solving an optimization problem.
    # For simplicity, we use a common heuristic related to the LQR cost function.
    # alpha = a_max^T R a_max / (lambda_max(K^T R K))
    # Let's use a simpler heuristic related to V = x^T P x
    # Terminal cost V(x_N - xbar) <= alpha
    # For linearization point xbar_lin = [0,0,0.1,0], ubar_lin = [0.1,0]
    # We can choose alpha based on some desired level set of the terminal cost.
    # A common approach is to choose alpha such that the LQR controller's inputs
    # don't violate constraints near the origin.
    # Let's assume the terminal state is close to xbar. u_N = -K(x_N - xbar)
    # We need ||u_N||_inf <= max_acc
    # ||-K(x_N - xbar)||_inf <= max_acc
    # max_j |(K(x_N - xbar))_j| <= max_acc_j
    # Consider the quadratic form x_diff^T P x_diff <= alpha
    # We can find the max alpha such that there exists a state x_N where x_diff = x_N - xbar
    # satisfies ||-K x_diff||_inf <= max_acc AND x_diff^T P x_diff = alpha
    # This is related to the control invariant set.
    # A conservative alpha can be derived from the maximum allowable state deviation under LQR.
    # Let's use a simple heuristic: Choose alpha such that a state deviation x_diff
    # resulting in max acceleration command satisfies x_diff^T P x_diff = alpha.
    # If ||K x_diff||_inf = max_acc, what is x_diff^T P x_diff?
    # Let's use a simpler approach related to the cost function value.
    # The terminal cost is V(x_N) = (x_N - xbar)^T P (x_N - xbar). We want V(x_N) <= alpha.
    # Consider the state deviation x_diff that results in the maximum allowed input under LQR:
    # max_j |(K x_diff)_j| = max_acc_j
    # This boundary defines an ellipsoid in state space. We want alpha to be the maximum
    # value of x_diff^T P x_diff on this boundary.
    # The largest ellipsoid x_diff^T P x_diff <= alpha contained in ||K x_diff||_inf <= max_acc
    # has alpha = 1 / max_j ( (K^T (R)^-1 K)_j,j / P_j,j ) -- this is for continuous time
    # For discrete time, it's more complex. A common approach: find alpha such that
    # the LQR control for any state on the boundary x_diff^T P x_diff = alpha
    # satisfies the input constraints.
    # A simpler heuristic: Pick a state x_boundary such that ||K x_boundary||_inf = max_acc
    # and set alpha = x_boundary^T P x_boundary. This is still complex.

    # Let's use a more direct approach from common MPC practices for terminal sets.
    # Find the largest alpha such that for all x_N with (x_N - xbar)^T P (x_N - xbar) <= alpha,
    # the LQR control u_N = -K(x_N - xbar) satisfies ||u_N||_inf <= max_acc.
    # This means for all x_diff such that x_diff^T P x_diff <= alpha, we have |(K x_diff)_j| <= max_acc_j for j=0,1.
    # This is equivalent to: for each j, max_{x_diff: x_diff^T P x_diff <= alpha} |(K x_diff)_j| <= max_acc_j.
    # The maximum of |(K x_diff)_j| over x_diff^T P x_diff <= alpha is sqrt(alpha * (K P^-1 K^T)_j,j).
    # So we need sqrt(alpha * (K P^-1 K^T)_j,j) <= max_acc_j for all j.
